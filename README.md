# SPEED-CONTROL-OF-BLDC-MOTOR
This MATLAB Simulink model controls a BLDC motor using a three-phase inverter, Hall sensor-based commutation, and PID speed regulation. The PID controller adjusts the PWM duty cycle to maintain the desired speed with real-time feedback. Scopes visualize rotor speed, torque, phase currents, and back-EMF for performance monitoring.
