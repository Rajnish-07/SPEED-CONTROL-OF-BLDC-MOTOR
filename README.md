# SPEED-CONTROL-OF-BLDC-MOTOR
This project implements BLDC motor speed control using MATLAB Simulink, featuring a three-phase inverter, Hall sensor-based commutation, and PID regulation. The PID controller dynamically adjusts PWM duty cycles to maintain the desired speed. Real-time monitoring of rotor speed, torque, phase currents, and back-EMF ensures performance analysis. The model accurately controls motor operation based on Hall sensor feedback and commutation logic. Users can run simulations, visualize results on scopes, and fine-tune the PID controller for optimal performance.
